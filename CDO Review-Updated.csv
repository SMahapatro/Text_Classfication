"Oversharing is very sensitive topic for our customers and the proposed ideas below will be really useful for any customers having oversharing concerns to understand what the impact would be when enabling Copilot and will be able to make informed decision on their path forward. 
The provided explanation about oversharing with links is a bit misleading. It can be found under question 154 in https://aka.ms/m365copilotfaq. The question and the answers are: 
My customer is concerned about oversharing through links. When I create a link for Everyone does that mean the file will show up in search for everyone? 
When you create a file sharing link for everyone it does not mean that the file will show up in search or Copilot responses for everyone. They would need to click on the link for them to be registered as a user with access to that file. When the link is deleted that user will no longer have access to the file and it will not show up in their search or Copilot results. 
The above answer is a bit misleading since there is no Everyone group or link option in SharePoint Online, there is Anyone link option available. 
The above text does not cover other type of sharing link like ""People in  your organization&gt;"" which might mislead people to think the guidance above applies to these type of link as well. That would be wrong assumption since when you share with People in your organization Copilot will index documents shared via these links and will return them in Copilot queries. I have tested this with my Copilot Preview access and that was my experience. I have not clicked any links to have them registered - files that I was not aware of were returned in my Copilot queries. 
As well as highlighting in the document that any SPO sites (including Teams teams) for which users have no idea that they have access to via a Group, nested group or direct access will be returned in Copilot queries.

"In FY24 we have the same problem in achieving our Purview OKR goals as we did in FY23 a large number of customers are completely adopted for MIP P2 but have no intent for IRM. Also, just as FY23 this fiscal year there is no partner in the ATU, STU or CSU who is goaled on adoption for Purview outside of the pay-for-support CSA role which is not possible/acceptable for many of our customers. Last fiscal year, in partnership between the OKR Champ team and our Americas SME team, an engagement approach was put together which started a pre-intent discussion led by an assigned Fasttrack SME and evolved into our standard deployment project approach. In the new evolved delivery model, there is not a set of tasks for the pre-intent portion of work and therefore leaves us without a way to address the initial discussions with our customers. During FY23, we ran this pre intent for IRM ""play"" dozens of times and saw a nearly perfect result with our customers moving quickly from no intent to 20% usage for IRM.

There is a big gap between the technical implementation and user adoption materials. That middle piece of the business partners and getting them hooked in, that is missing. There is a big stakeholder piece in the middle because that stakeholder piece is focusing on what are your business problems but we don’t want to know what our problems are, we know what the solution is. We want to sell to them what the solution is (Viva Learning). Then showcase Viva Learning and get them really hooked on Viva Learning, what it can do for them, how it can be used in their parts of the business, how they can sponsor usage across the business globally. 


That middle piece of senior business adopters is missing. You need those people across the business to really get it, love it and want to sell it into the business. It is a big miss in the current Microsoft adoption approach. Need to make sure it positioned not as “what are your problems and we’ve got a good idea for a solution”, but it needs to be positioned “this is rolling out into your business, let us show you why”.

"Presently, we lack a guide or assessment for a customer to understand their information protection and governance readiness to move forward with Copilot. Customers who have been nominated and extended invitations to participate in the Copilot Early Access Program (EAP) have regularly expressed this concern and are seeking an understanding on how to verify their implementation of information protection and governance policies before enabling Copilot for their users. 
 
The current Microsoft 365 Copilot setup guide (ADG) only includes guidance on requirements/pre-requisites to assign licenses and enable Copilot features. However, a common slide presented by CSU SMEs is the ""Optimized for Microsoft 365 Copilot"" recommendations (images attached). Optimizations include Information Protection Labeling, Content / Data Migration for Semantic Indexing, SharePoint Site Restrictions, Access Reviews, Data Loss Prevention, and Retention Policies. 
 
This slide would be much less overwhelming if we had an Advanced Deployment Guide that walks the customer through steps to verify their data is protected. Customers could leverage an ADG with all resources listed in one location so they are not scrambling to understand how to enable all of the optimizations and can track progress of each item. This could save time for our customers and our FastTrack team who spend countless hours looking for documentation and resources.

"Issues Addressed: 

Administrators often encounter challenges in efficiently accessing our guides, leading to knowledge gaps, reduced efficiency, and frustration. This proposal directly tackles these issues by harnessing AI to create a personalized recommendation system for wizards and guides, curated to match administrators' specific roles and needs. Additionally, it addresses the challenge of enabling on-the-job learning for administrators, enhancing their skills while they work. 
Tailored Guidance for Admins: 

I've been exploring ways to elevate the value we provide to our administrators. One exciting avenue is utilizing AI to create a personalized recommendation system for our IPE wizards and guides that align with their specific roles in the admin portal. 

Simplifying the Vision: 

	Smart Recommendations (Classification Model): By tapping into machine learning, specifically classification models, we can predict which wizards and guides suit administrators' roles and access levels. This approach ensures admins find content tailored to their responsibilities, saving time and enhancing their effectiveness. 
	 
	Relevant Content Boost (Content-Based Filtering): Introducing a content-based recommendation system can align administrators' profile attributes with the content they need. This harmony between user traits and content relevance can redefine the admin experience, making their journey smoother. 
	 
	Insight-Driven Choices (Matrix Factorization): Matrix factorization helps us uncover hidden patterns in how administrators interact with wizards and guides. Armed with this knowledge, we can anticipate their preferences and offer tailored recommendations that address their unique needs.
	 
Advantages for Our Customers: 
 
	Engaged Admins, Stronger Enterprise: Tailoring content for admins reinforces their engagement, directly contributing to theirenterprise's achievements.
	 
	Efficiency in Action: Administrators will navigate to pertinent content seamlessly, boosting efficiency and overall productivity.
	 
	Nurturing Excellence: Aligning content with admins' profiles fosters a culture of excellence, driving our enterprise's proficiency.
	 
	
I'm genuinely excited about the potential of this initiative. Please add any additional feedback or thoughts you may have on this item.

I suggest adding certain visualization to Migration Reporting on FastTrack Portal, like charts that we had in PBI reporting at the top of each page. 


This visualization would be used for overall summary in each migration project and it would be visually more appealing than having plain numbers as we have now.

What idea are you suggesting? Currently the Migration Manager does a 10 move batch and doesn't process any new moves till it has moved all 10 in the currrent batch. We would like Migration Manager to manage a queue and keep 10 migrations moving all the time instead of batching. So that we are moving data as fast as possible instead of being stuck on one migration finishing before ramping back up to a 10 thread volume. 


How would you implement this? When one move finishes pickup another move scheduled to move until you have moved all of the files shares.

Healthcare Customers have asked for guidance on how to approach the Copilot EAP (Early Access Program) deployment considering that the Semantic Indexing that is part of Copilot is not included in their Business Associates Agreement, which isn't HIPAA compliant. CELA has responded to KP (and other customers) that typically EAPs should not be used with Production data. This has caused KP to halt their project and are waiting to make a decision if they should even proceed with the EAP. We are looking to get further clarification from CELA, although they are hesitant to meet directly with the customer. The response below does not look like the author understood how Copilot works, and its need for production data and that customers have actually paid to use this product. This issue has been raised through the CSU to the PG, but yet to see what is to come from it. 


Here is response sent to customer where I have bolded the most concerning comment --&gt; 


Thanks for following up. Happy to meet with KP legal as needed, however, let’s please first get internal alignment on a response. As a general matter, HIPAA BAA does not cover preview products. It is usually not a concern for customers due to the limited use in preview (typically no live data, including PHI, are shared). Hence, preview terms specify that the product is NOT covered by the BAA. More importantly, it’s not covered because it has not undergone the full compliance review that is required for HIPAA BAA onboarding, and so it’s actually not something we can negotiate around, and our customers can choose whether they participate in early access, and also manage their use with the limited compliance framework. I hope this is helpful to move the conversation forward here.

All migration that FastTrack support within our scope.


What is the problem/idea?


Request for the details of Migration learning to be put in the FastTrack Service Description public website rather than in fasttrack.microsoft.com .


Problem: Several partner feedback that there are too many steps and the barrier of entry is too high to get into the step/documentation of Migration detail and process. User need to get into fasttrack.microsoft.com first 1) setup account, - not include if the tenant creation or testing needed 2) sign in, 3) create account, 4) until they get the part of migration details. Many times, these detail information is already being discussed in presales to assess if the fasttrack process, benefit, and requirement is sufficient or additional effort/budget needed after the purchase.


What are they trying to do/achieve and/or what problem is encountered?


they - customer or partner- either cancel, ignore it, or not moving forward when it's taking too many steps. sometimes they ended up asking too many questions to FastTrack FPM/FE/SME


Why is solving the problem important?


Fasten the decision making on budget, on deployment planning as early as possible. Reduce and prevent the potential escalation or potential blocker to deploy when customer realized they could not pursue with fasttrack process, and need to use additional cost with partner or tools.


What impact is the issue having?


Increase time to value. Prolong the deployment planning discussion. Potential blocking the timeline. Potential restriction, issue, approval that just figured out only when the license is purchased or only when RFA is made on assessment stage, is late.


What use case does this address?





Proposed solution (optional):


Put all the details on migration learning content details in FastTrack Service Description or public website. Enable customer and partner to get these information access as easy and as early as possible.

For Healthcare customers, ensuring our services are HIPAA complaint are covered by the Business Associate Agreement (BAA). Unfourtantely, the Semantic Indexing capability utilized by Copilot is not yet covered by the BAA. This is causing Healthcare customers to pause the Copilot projects and determine how to proceed - do they pause entirely, limit who has access to Copilot, thus limiting the value of the EAP. The actual end user applications (like Outlook, Word, etc) are covered by the BAA - but not the Semantic Index back-end capability that allows for Copilot to fully function. The PG does plan to have an audit completed, but it is unknown if this will happen prior to GA.

Customers who have been nominated and extended invitations to participate in the Copilot Early Access Program (EAP) have expressed valid concerns regarding the potential overexposure of internal data to their employees. One particular concern is the potential exposure after semantic indexing runs, which could inadvertently expose data to all employees. 


Presently, we lack a definitive guide or assessment for a customer to understand their information protection readiness to move forward with Copilot. To address these concerns effectively, customers are seeking a comprehensive understanding of how to ensure and verify their implementation of information protection and governance policies before enabling Copilot for their users. 


One recommendation highlighted in our Copilot guidance and instructional materials is leveraging the AI capabilities offered by Microsoft Syntex for automated document classification. While this may present a viable solution, Syntex would be an added cost and is not currently covered by FastTrack. 


Customer is requesting that we provide better guidance and/or a structured assessment specifically around Information Protection readiness for Copilot.

As highlighted in the June 2023 FastTrack All Hands, Microsoft customers sometinmes have unclear intent to deploy MDE due to a competiting incumbent solution such as Crowdstrike. As the FastTrack team highlighted in the call, they were able to overcome objections to non-MDE workloads (MDA) by running a pilot that demonstrated how MDE could run in passive mode alongside Crowdstrike while delivering additional value realisation from the E5 stack. There are several such examples (Passive: MDE EndPoint DLP --&gt; IRM, or MDE --&gt; MDA / MDCA), but none of these are easily demonstrated or discussed due to the lack of any centralised documentation. Perhaps we could come up with a common set of guidelines for what is possible to do with MDE in Passive mode to further the compete plays in other E5 Security and Compliance areas. Over time, this gives us much greater leverage against difficult competitors.

I have observed that the Deployment Wizards for Teams Setup Guide and Phone System Deployment provide distinct sets of networking guidance information. In my view, it would be advantageous for consistency purposes if the networking guidance were standardized across all deployment wizards, including their titles. Moreover, I appreciate the inclusion of the Quality and Reliability Checklist information (see attached screenshot) and think it should be included. Additionally, it may be beneficial to incorporate or add the discussion on Call Quality Dashboard (CQD) and Building Tenant File when addressing networking matters with customers.

The Plan stage of project progress is not relevant to the vast majority of customer engagements. A remediation checklist was helpful in the early days of the OBC when customers were relatively immature, but these days customers are coming to us with specific questions for specific workloads. This means we are going directly to Tech Onboarding, and the Plan step is just unnecessary administrative and DQ overhead. 


I suggest removing Plan altogether, or at least make the tasks optional (not required) so we can bypass it on the way to Tech Onboarding. 


The Playbook should also include, perhaps in Kickoff, a prompt to check for relevant IPEs/ADGs/wizards. In fact, it would be useful if the tool could suggest IPEs that might apply to the workloads in scope. This would be far more practical and useful than a remediation checklist task.

I would like to recommend a change to unify all security Defender BVDs into one BVD, instead of having separate BVDs for MDE MDO MDI MDA. The new BVD would focus on Security (XDR) and educate the customer about it in 3 to 4 slides. Then, the presenters would pause on a slide that shows all the XDR workloads and let the customer choose the first workload they are interested in. 


<span style=""background-color:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6)"">This would help maintain the customer engagement with FTC even after we complete the enablement for one workload.

I would like to propose an improvement that would enhance the customer experience of running the MDE wizard (ADG). 


Since most of our customers are already using Intune, it would be helpful if we could update the wizard to include clear instructions and links to enable the connectors from both Intune and MDE sides. This way, the customer can easily navigate to the relevant page where they need to enable the connector and once done they will return to the wizard and carry on the rest of the wizard steps. By the end of the wizard, all Intune enrolled devices will be in the onboarding phase. 


I think this will save time and accelerate the customer adoption of the service. It will also help the SME save time can focus more on the educational/QA and other onboarding activities.

What idea are you suggesting? The tasks 4008 from FTOP must be udpated 


Next points should be adressed: 


  
	FTOP (task 4008): 
	
	  
		Update the taks name and remove PowerBI from the name
		 
		Update the taks description and remove PowerBI and replace it with new reporting tool from FTC Portal
		 
		Replace the deck that contains guidance about PowerBI with a new deck that guides the customer to use new reporting tool from FTC Portal
		 
		 
		 
		
		
	 
	
	 
	LC Page: 
	  
		Update the LC page to reflect the new guidance for the reporting tool from FTC Portal
		 
		Replace the deck that contains guidance about PowerBI with a new deck that guides the customer to use new reporting tool from FTC Portal

What idea are you suggesting? The Migration Workshop decks (both in LC and FTOP) have still the reference about PowerBI Reporting tool. We should remove the PowerBI reference from the deck and guide the customer to use the reporting tool from withing FTC Portal. 


How would you implement this? Remove the information from the deck and add the new iinformation. 


What measurable impact would this idea have? (hours per week or month). It will not reduce the effort. It will correct the guidance

Problem statement: Often the customers operate in the FT portal / MigHub with an adminstrator account that might not have a mailbox (or it might be unmonitored), and that can lead to missed emails. Here's an example based in a real situation: 


 
	User in the FT portal starts a chat with MST.
	 
	MST creates a ticket.
	 
	MST wants to arrange a call with the customer for troubleshooting, and asks via email the user who created the ticket.
	 
	The email assigned to the user in the FT portal is unmonitored. Subsequent emails are missed and MST closes the ticket.
	 
	The FT user sees that the ticket is closed, unexpectedly for them.
	 
	 
	



Idea:if available, communicate with the FT user using the recipients specified in the project card because: 


 
	the customer is much more likely to specify a valid email address there because otherwise they won't receive event notifications.
	 
	typically there are a few recipients specified, so it's more resilient for OOF/vacation situations.
	 
	 
	



If there are no recipients in the project card the use the email address for the FT user as a backup. 


As an alternate idea/solution, ask for the user email address when a ticket is submitted.

What is the problem/idea? Why is solving the problem important? 


Customers can submit migration events before prerequisites are complete. These migration events will probably fail, leading to customer frustration. 


What are they trying to do/achieve and/or what problem is encountered? 


Customer is doing a GDrive to ODFB migration. One of the prerequisite steps is to have a call with MST to create/verify the Mover connectors and app authorizations in AADP. Until this call is done and all is found to be OK the MST will not consider the migration project active/ready to accept migrations, and any event submitted by the customer will fail because MST won't accept/process it. 


What impact is the issue having?  


Delayed migration due to avoidable test migration failures, customer disatisfaction. 


Proposed solution: 


In MigHub, disable UI elements related to event creation until the project is marked as active/ready by MST. Optionally, add a final item such as ""I confirm that I have completed all prerequisites and I'm ready to submit migration events"". 


Next to the disabled element add a link to the project prerequisites in the project card/learning center.

Since Microsoft 365 Copilot has been announced and there is a paid private preview coming available for customers, many FTAs are asking for additional readiness and content on Microsoft 365 Copilot. The STU and their field counterparts are constantly asking for FastTrack's involvement in Microsoft 365 Copilot. I recommend we have a few different content pieces created for the FTAs. 
 
 
 
1. Have a couple of bullets that FTAs can communicate to their field counterparts on where FastTrack is in the Microsoft 365 Copilot journey. We should also have a customer-facing talking point to address any inquiries from customers. 


2. Provide the elevator pitch and training that the field teams have received to the FTAs. This will ensure we are all on the same page on how M365 Copilot is being communicated to customers and how the field is pitching the preview. 


3. Learning path for FTAs on Copilot. I am sure this is in the works, but it would be great to give the FTAs a timeline on when they can expect a learning path on Copilot. (Totally fine if the answer is H2.)

In the Intune Setup Guide, there is not guidance for enrolling existing devices into Autopilot - it does not specify that Autopilot features service existing devices - my customer had confusion on this and was not aware they should be enrolling existing devices through Autopilot or why.

What idea are you suggesting? 


Suggesting that we revamp the Remediation Checklist and implement the RCL within the Admin Center as an initial point for customers beginning their journey with IPE. It'll gather the information needed as usual to assess the customers current environment/needs/etc. 


Once those are all captured we can then use/store this data within the Microsoft 365 Admin Center. Using the data within the ADG's/IPE wizards as an API or in a way that passes the RCL info to the ADGs/IPE wizards. That way we would be providing customers an automated/curated experience that is tailored to their wants or needs. 


For example customers would go through the RCL in the admin center, it then provides them options of what to deploy first from the ADG list. They select Intune. The Intune ADG will then already have all the information it needs to provide them with the steps they need to complete deployment. 


This will also provide Microsoft Support/FastTrack etc. with valuble information needed during troubleshooting or during engagements to have an idea of what the customers environment currently entails. As opposed to having to go through the RCL which may come off as inundated material that doesn't really fit anymore with the new IPE process. 


What measurable impact would this idea have? (hours per week or month): 


I believe that this change would save multiple weeks/months of work and also really help align our customers to adopting automation. It would help them see the benefit in moving to automation and give them more of a reason to pursue using the IPE wizards.

Background: The field teamin Thailand has recently reached to FastTrack team to support their customer to deploy and setup all M365 workloads in a non-production tenant. We have responded to the field team that FastTrack support customers to deploy M365 workloads in production tenant only. Field team highlighted they are unable to find any clause in our <a href=""https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Ffasttrack%2Fintroduction&amp;data=05%7C01%7CLee.Stephanie%40microsoft.com%7C83cdc3cbc24940cf890e08db55b12efd%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638197991815288807%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=cBy8pixl9LmXFdryg2OcbAz%2B9DTlwI0XsiDPgQqX8h4%3D&amp;reserved=0"" style=""color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"">FastTrack Center Benefit for Microsoft 365​ - FastTrack – Microsoft 365 | Microsoft Learnthat states “FastTrack do not support non-production tenant deployment” and they highlighted this is causing confusion to our customers since this is not clearly defined in the M365 FastTrack Benefits site and the customers are quite unahappy with this. 
 
 
 
Ask: To ensure FastTrack team stay focus to support our customers to deploy M365 workloads in production tenant so that our customers can maximize the ROI on their M365/O365 investment, it is important to include this clause in our “FastTrack Center Benefit for Microsoft 365” site to avoid confusion to the field team and our customers in the future.

Licenses Usage within the Defender portal (Settings &gt; Endpoint &gt; Licenses) is causing confusion with customers


When evaluating the actual usage for 'Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Server' SKU, it shows that 0 licenses (of total amount) have been utilized.


The customer has been deploying MDE to their servers and do not know (per this interface) the number of remaining licensees.


Although, I have explained to the customer that this is not an accurate representation of the number of servers have been onboarded to Defender and we can run reports to see the number of servers that have actually be onboarded to Defender.


This is okay for the technical team, but this becomes more of and 'issue' during license renewal. When the accounting team looks at the licenses they purchased and sees that they are not utilizing 'Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Server' licenses purchased, the account team question if they should continue to renew the above licenses.


Within FT, we do not deal with licensing, but they have come to us to get clarification on how the licenses have been distributed amongst their servers.

Customer found an bug in the LAPS Preview intune policy. Currently they have a case open but the main issue is that the reporting is faulty for manual rotation of the local admin password. The device status shows pending but under the device overview toolbar it will pop up a blue bar that says active which in testing means it has in fact rotated the password but without a lot of testing nothing states that would be the case.
